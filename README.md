# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage to filter data on UFOs. Data must be filtered by date of sighting, city, state, country, and shape of UFO.

## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Results
To perform a search of the data, you can use the the five filters as seen belo.

By typing in value for one of the five filters, the table will automatically populate the data.

 ## Challenge Summary
  This web page is very helpful in filtering UFO data, but without sorting through the data at first, it is difficult to know what to search. You may want to search for a date that doesn't exist in the data and this site does not have a field for that. To improve about this website it would be best to provide a filtering table that changes as you begin to type. This way when you begin typing a date, all the dates close to the date will populate below for you to choose from the drop down. Also, filtering for key words in the comments would help for those who want to find a UFO on a specific type of sighting. For example, filterting by "green" in the comments. These options would make this page much more user friendly and better at digging into the data.
